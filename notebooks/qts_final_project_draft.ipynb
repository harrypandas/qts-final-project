    "- As of at least some times in your simulation, simultaneously holds at least 5 distinct assets (different currencies, commodities, option maturities/strikes etc.)\n",
    "- Produces a total of 40 trades or more over your entire analysis/simulation period, without excessive clustering\n",
    "- Leverage, with documented and reasonable capital and risk control assumptions\n"

    "### Strategy Overview\n",
    "The end goal here is to create a quantile trading strategy that ranks equities based on their expected drift after the initial earnings surprise announcement. We estimate this expected drift by taking the percentage earnings surprise each quarter for a limited amount of equities and then compare that to the next day price move of that equity. Hopefully, the less the price move is relative to the earnings surprise, the more there is to capture in the post-drift. For metric standardization purposes, we will z-score this metric, \"surprise vs. price move\" within a separated bin based on the average EPS size to minimize the effects of large surprises versus small estimates. For diversification purposes we will also add in some other fundamental and technical indicators related to growth and momentum and Z-score those as well in a similar manner. To begin, we will weight the z-score of the \"surprise vs. price move\" metric more heavily, as we use that as our thesis, and vary the weights of the other indicators as we see the results. More information about data collection, order execution, and risk and liquidity constraints can be found below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Acquisition\n",
    "- EPS Actual Data and Consensus Estimates/Surprise Metrics for Equities from WRDS I/B/E/S\n",
    "- Equity close prices from NASDAQ's 'QUOTEMEDIA/PRICES' dataset\n",
    "- Fundamental and market value data from NASDAQ's ZACKS Fundamental B dataset\n",
    "- Execution data from WRDS BARS dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Constraints/Specifications\n",
    "- To minimize risk we plan on taking a long/short quantile approach as well as instituting a stop loss of 10% on any stock\n",
    "- In addition, we will limit position sizes of any individual stock to 5% of the total portfolio\n",
    "- We plan on acquiring larger position sizes up to the limitations above on a particular percentage of the quantile we choose.\n",
    "- We have limited the equities to an investable universe of companies that haven't dipped below $500 million in market value within the time period, to ensure reasonable liquidity.\n",
    "- Based on the lookback period below, We will start out with 10*gross notional of our first position,which we will borrow at OIS+50bps. Subsequently, every rebalance/lookback period, we will adjust the capital based on the unrealized an realized P&L of our holdings. We will maintain the 10x leverage based on the capital throughout the lifecycle of the strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints/Parameters we will test/vary as we implement out approach\n",
    "- Quantile size(q)\n",
    "    - The way we invest in quantiles will also be modified as we will weight better and worse rankings within each quantile differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lookback Period(L) - We will look at both results for a lookback period of 3 months and shorter periods to re-sort our quantile rankings\n",
    "    - In the 3 - month approach, the strategy is minimally dynamic and we will adapt the portfolio holdings every 3-months based on the new rankings for the quarter\n",
    "    - In the shorter period lookbacks, we will keep a running tally of rankings, adding equities to the rankings once a certain amount of equities earnings have been announced, and we will re-evaluate rankings and portfolio holdings after every subsequent L period."
